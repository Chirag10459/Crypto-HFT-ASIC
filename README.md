- **Built-in primitive trading strategy** (BTC/ETH arbitrage)
- **Host PC override capability** via SPI interface
- **Custom buy/sell limits and quantities** configurable in real-time
- **Professional SystemVerilog implementation** ready for FPGA/ASIC

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Icarus Verilog (â‰¥ 10.0)
- GTKWave (optional, for waveform viewing)
- Python 3.x (for host control software)

### Compile and Run
